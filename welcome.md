I'm Eric Brown, a teacher, husband, father, rotarian, engineer, sailor and runner.

## A brief bio

Starting August 2023, I am a teaching at the San Lorenzo Valley tricampus. Prior to that I worked as an engineer at Khan Academy, Apple, Adobe, Sony, Kodak, and a string of smaller companies, startups and non-profits. I've also led programs encouraging youth leadership and character development in San Lorenzo Valley schools.

I received my Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering in 1990 from the University of Rochester. And I've run marathons and raced sailboats competitively for several decades.
