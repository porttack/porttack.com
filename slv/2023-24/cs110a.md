1. **Consistent Effort and Progress on Units and Mini-Projects - 40%** 💪🔄
   As students enter with different proficiencies, effort and improvement are more important than the quantity of content covered. The teacher will set expectations per student.

2. **Typing/Keyboarding Mastery to 6th Grade Level - 20%** ⌨️📈
   Demonstrating proficiency in typing and keyboarding skills at a typical 6th-grade level.

3. **Speaking and Listening - 20%** 🗣️👂
   Active participation and engagement in speaking and listening activities.

4. **Weekly Reflections - 10%** 📝🗓️
   Regular reflections on the learning process and personal growth.

5. **Final Project - 10%** 🏁🎉
   Completion and presentation of a creative and well-executed final project.

💻 Typing.com and Grok Academy have minimum end-of-quarter expectations. If expectations are met or there is an excused absence, students will not be penalized. 🚀

In this course, we value your effort, progress, and active involvement in the learning journey. Let's work together to make this an enjoyable and rewarding experience for everyone! 🌟
