## Seventh Grade Computer Science - Exploring Programming with Python 🚀

Welcome to seventh grade computer science.

Exploring Programming with Python is a lighter version of our high school intro to computer science class, some might call it a splash into the fundamentals of programming. It is designed to engage and excite future computer science students. The curriculum is taught using text-based coding in Python. Exploring Programming with Python also revolves around graphics-based problem solving and has similar visually engaging notes, checkpoints, exercises, and projects for students to complete. Students also have an opportunity to work with various aspects of physical computing.

 Students will be joining exciting NCSS Challenge. Kick start your coding adventure! 🏆🚀 Collect points at all levels. 📈

#### 9/8 Movie: Screenagers Next Chapter (about teen anxiety)

🎬 We will be watching and discussing this movie in class. It discusses sensitive issues we all know about in society but don't always openly discuss. SLV is also screening this movie for parents and students the evening of 9/14. More info is at [www.porttack.com/screenagers](/screenagers). 🍿🗣️💬🌐

#### Guest Speakers

We may have guest speakers from time-to-time. It is important for students to be on their best behavior. 😊

## For Parents/Guardians

 I previously taught some of the digital citizenship/literacy curriculum currently being implemented in this class. There is an assiciated parenting book called "[Raising Humans in a Digital World: Helping Kids Build a Healthy Relationship with Technology](https://www.cyberwise.org/book)" by Diana Graber. You can read more about why this curriculum was selected in the "[Cultivating Digital Citizenship: Empowering Our Children in a Connected World](/2020/01/01/cybercivics.html)" blog post.

If you are a parent working in a technology field we're discussing in our symposium or any other classes I'm teaching, I'd love to hear from you. While middle school students are starting to not want parents in their classes the way they did in elementary school, they still need us and want to learn from our life experiences.

Additionally:
* **ASAP** - Please sign this syllabus with your child and return it or email it to me. 🖋️👩‍👧‍👦
* **8/17** - Please come to Back To School Night so I can meet you! 🏫🌃🤝
* **9/14** - Please watch [Screenagers Next Chapter](/screenagers) with us at 6:30pm. 🎥🍿🕡
* Join us on a Tuesday evening for [CoderDojo](/slv/2023-24/coderdojo) 🌙

## Coding Platforms:

CS 110A will use the following coding platforms:

- [Grok Academy](https://groklearning.com/launch/)
- [Microbit classroom](https://makecode.microbit.org/) (Try the [tutorial](https://makecode.microbit.org/#editor)!)
- Google Colab
- The Mu editor
- Other websites as necessary

## Weekly Cadence

### Mondays

In August, Mondays will start with the NCSS coding challenge. September onward, Monday classes will start with 10-minute micro lessons from AP Computer Science students. The best way to learn something is to teach it. And these micro-lessons are as much for the AP students as they are for 7th graders to learn something new. 

We will take a brief break as the AP students are excused and we'll either have a lesson or continue with project work.

### Wednesdays

* Five Minute Coding Challenge (so get to class on time!)
* 7th Grade Tech Symposium (similar to [High School Tech Symposium](/slv/2023-24/symposium))
* Nick and Tesla (and sometimes a brief break)
* Programming, lesson, or project work

### Fridays

* Five Minute Coding Challenge (so get to class on time!)
* Electronics or Physical Computing
* Nick and Tesla (and sometimes a brief break)
* Ongoing lesson or project work
