## Course Description

Become a creator. Discover the power of coding as you explore the Python programming language to control a wide array of robotics technologies and **Internet of Things** (IoT).

In this hands-on learning experience, you'll delve into the fundamentals of electronics, sensors, coding, and 3D printing (time permitting). Gain practical knowledge in designing and assembling circuits, and unleash your creativity in creating functional 3D-printed components. With IoT, you'll have opportunities to explore cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and internet-connected gadgets, uncovering their immense potential for solving real-world problems.

As you progress, you'll embark on exciting projects that merge the realms of programming, robotics, and/or IoT, allowing you to bring your ideas to life. You'll work with circuits, motors, servos, and sensors, expanding your knowledge of electronics and honing your problem-solving skills. Moreover, you'll develop critical thinking, communication, and teamwork abilities through collaborative project-based activities.

Immerse yourself in the cutting-edge world of "Programming, Robotics, and the Internet of Things" and shape the future with your innovative creations. Gain the skills and confidence to build and control intelligent devices, paving the way for a promising future in the realm of technology and innovation.
