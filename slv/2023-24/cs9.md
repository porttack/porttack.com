## 🚀 Empowering Digital Creators and Citizens 🌍

Get ready for Monday morning tech discussions and activities as we embark on an  adjunct to the "IT Essentials" class! 🚀💻 On Monday mornings, students will be immersed in the world of digital citizenship and media literacy, learning skills that go beyond the basics and empower them to be creators in the digital age.

Through engaging discussions covering topics such as copyright, cryptography, fake news, social media, anxiety, algorithms, media companies, artificial intelligence, Large Language Models (like ChatGPT), and more, students will explore the frontiers of technology. They'll embrace their role as future leaders in the digital realm, cultivating critical thinking abilities to discern truth from fiction, fostering their journey as savvy digital consumers and creators. 💬💡

Understanding the value of being safe and responsible producers, students will learn to navigate the digital landscape with confidence, while recognizing the dangers of over-consumption. Empowered as responsible digital citizens, they'll be ready to make a positive impact on the larger world. 🌍🔍

Join us for this invigorating journey where every Monday morning will be a stepping stone towards an empowered future as digital creators and global citizens! 🌐🌟

## Other Activities

In the first 3 weeks, all students will participate in the NGSS and build a few coding skills.

Students who wish to learn more about Chromebooks, how they work, and help fix them are able to work on a self-paced curriculum. Mr. Brown can approve of this privilege.
