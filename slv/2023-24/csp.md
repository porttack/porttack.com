## Computer Science Principals AP Description

**Grades:** 10-12 (or brief teacher interview)
<br>
**Prerequisites:** Math 1 (or brief teacher interview)
<br>
(A teacher interview’s primary purpose is to assess maturity and set rigor expectations. Email [Mr. Brown](mailto:ebrown@slvusd.org) to schedule.)

**Course Goal:** Provide students with opportunities to learn and demonstrate computer science skills colleges consider favorably during admissions. 

**Rigor Expectations:**
* We will use either Harvard or Carnegie Mellon AP curriculum designed for Algebra-ready 10th-12th graders.
* There is a mandatory performance project due in April. This is worth 30% of the grade. Classroom time is allocated.
* As college admissions favor deep commitments to students’ areas of study, participation in CruzHacks 2024 (February), Santa Cruz Engineering/Science Fair, Raspberry Pi Coolest Projects, and/or California Invention Convention is strongly encouraged and supported.
* There is a reasonable amount of homework.

**Teacher’s Note/Goal:** Computer Science and Engineering are fun. It isn’t always easy – I get frustrated at my computer sometimes – but I hope to inspire students to experience the same thrill and enjoyment I get from solving problems with technology. I will attempt to adjust expectations and projects appropriate to students’ abilities.
