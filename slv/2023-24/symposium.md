[Optional CoderDojo](/slv/2023-24/coderdojo): 1st Tuesday Evenings 🌙

## 🚀 Empowering Digital Creators and Citizens 🌍

Get ready for Monday morning tech discussions and activities as we embark on an  adjunct to the "IT Essentials" class. 🚀💻 On Monday mornings, students will be immersed in the world of digital citizenship and media literacy, learning skills that go beyond the basics and empower them to be creators in the digital age.

Through engaging discussions covering topics such as copyright, cryptography, fake news, social media, anxiety, algorithms, media companies, artificial intelligence, Large Language Models (like ChatGPT), and more, students will explore the frontiers of technology. They'll embrace their role as future leaders in the digital realm, cultivating critical thinking abilities to discern truth from fiction, fostering their journey as savvy digital consumers and creators. 💬💡

Understanding the value of being safe and responsible producers, students will learn to navigate the digital landscape with confidence, while recognizing the dangers of over-consumption. Empowered as responsible digital citizens, they'll be ready to make a positive impact on the larger world. 🌍🔍

Join us for this invigorating journey where every Monday morning will be a stepping stone towards an empowered future as digital creators and global citizens! 🌐🌟

#### Tech Club

Students who wish to learn more about Chromebooks, how they work, and help fix them are able to work on a self-paced curriculum. Mr. Brown most approve this privilege on a per-student basis.

## Required Materials:

* A folder with pockets for classroom work
* Lined looseleaf paper as needed 📝
* 2 sharpened pencils ✏️✏️
* Colored pencils or markers (optional) 🎨
* A chromebook 💻
* Masks (if you're not sure if your sick) 😷

## Special Tech Symposium Activities

#### 8/14, 8/21 & 8/28 Australian NCSS Challenge

[NCSS Challenge](https://groklearning.com/challenge/) - 8/14/23 - 9/2/23. All students will be joining exciting NCSS Challenge. Kick start your coding adventure! 🏆🚀 Collect points at all levels. 📈

#### 9/11 & 9/18 Movie: Screenagers Next Chapter (about teen anxiety)

🎬 We will be watching and discussing this movie in class. It discusses sensitive issues we all know about in society but don't always openly discuss. SLV is also screening this movie for parents and students the evening of 9/14. More info is at https://porttack.com/screenagers. 🍿🗣️💬🌐

#### Guest Speakers

We may have guest speakers from time-to-time. It is important for students to be on their best behavior. 😊

## For Parents/Guardians

While I'm a new teacher, I've taught some of this curriculum previously at SLVUSD. There is an assiciated parenting book called [Raising Humans in a Digital World: Helping Kids Build a Healthy Relationship with Technology](https://www.cyberwise.org/book) by Diana Graber. You can read more about why this curriculum was selected in the [Cultivating Digital Citizenship: Empowering Our Children in a Connected World](/2020/01/01/cybercivics.html) blog post.

If you are a parent working in a technology field we're discussing in this symposium or any other classes I'm teaching, I'd love to hear from you. While high school students don't want parents in their classes the way they did in elementary school, they still need us and want to learn from our life experiences.

Additionally:
* **ASAP** - Please sign this syllabus with your child and return it to me. 🖋️👩‍👧‍👦
