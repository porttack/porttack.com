## Sign Up & Requirements
Students, Family & Community are invited. But a signup is required (even if it is last minute). **We encourage parents and community attendance, but to attend the CoderDojo, SLVUSD requires some simple volunteer paperwork.** Youth safety is a priority.

Please return 8/27 for signup & adult paperwork.
