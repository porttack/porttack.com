### Club Purpose

Our club is all about encouraging collaboration and creativity through coding and making, including 3D printing. It's a place where we help each other grow our skills, solve problems, and bring ideas to life.

### What We Do

- Independent or Collaborative coding
- 3D printing projects (time & equipment permitting)
- Skill-sharing and learning from one another
- Building a community, belonging

### What We Don't Do

This is not a place for playing video or computer games. Our focus is on hands-on learning, creativity, and supporting each other in our coding and making endeavors.

We look forward to seeing you at SLV CoderDojo!
