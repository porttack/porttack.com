Friday Coding is a free after school program from 3:15 to 5:30 Sept 29-Dec 15 (10 weeks) and is open to up to fifteen 4th & 5th graders. Students will start and end the class at the SLE playground. We will use unplugged group activities, self-paced code.org curriculum (courses D-F depending on ability) and other coding and engineering related activities. Students will be encouraged to work together to solve problems and help each other.
