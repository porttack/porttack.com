# **What's Wrong with SEL? (Remember CBE?)**

*Why Social-Emotional Learning isn't enough—and how removing moral guardrails fuels student anxiety*

## **The Problem with SEL**

American schools face an unprecedented crisis. Despite decades of investment in social-emotional learning programs, youth anxiety and depression rates continue climbing. From 2010 to 2019, major depressive episodes among adolescents increased 60%. Suicide remains the second leading cause of death for ages 10-24.

We teach students to identify emotions, manage stress, and make responsible decisions. We implement SEL curricula, measure competencies, and celebrate improved emotional regulation. These efforts matter—but they're not enough.

**Something fundamental is missing from our approach to student wellbeing, and that missing piece is contributing to the very anxiety we're trying to address.**

## **What We Replaced: From Character-Based Education to Individual Skills**

Over the past three decades, American education shifted from character-based education to Social-Emotional Learning. This transition wasn't malicious—it emerged from legitimate concerns about cultural responsiveness and equity. But in our focus on developing individual competencies, we may have de-emphasized something important: the moral frameworks and community connections that help developing minds navigate ethical complexity.

Character-Based Education (CBE) isn't about religious indoctrination or cultural imperialism. It's about providing young people with tested moral frameworks—principles like integrity, responsibility, respect, and service—embedded within authentic communities where they belong and contribute.

Programs like 4-H, Scouting, quality athletic teams, and service clubs have always understood this. A Scout learns that being "trustworthy" means keeping commitments even when it's inconvenient. A 4-H member develops "character" through contributing to community projects. An athlete learns "teamwork" means putting collective success above personal glory.

**The distinction matters because SEL focuses on developing individual capacities while CBE focuses on developing identity within moral communities.**

## **The Neuroscience Problem: Developing Brains Need External Frameworks**

This individual-focused approach might work if teenagers possessed fully developed moral reasoning capabilities. They don't.

Neuroscience research consistently shows that the prefrontal cortex—responsible for executive function, impulse control, and complex moral reasoning—doesn't fully mature until around age 25. During adolescence, young people are biologically driven to take risks, seek peer approval, and make decisions based on immediate rewards rather than long-term consequences.

Asking teenagers to derive moral principles through empathy and self-reflection alone is like asking them to navigate mountain terrain without a compass. They need external frameworks to guide decision-making while their internal moral compass develops.

Character education provides exactly that: external moral scaffolding for developing minds. The Scout Law, the 4-H pledge, team codes of conduct, school honor codes—these aren't arbitrary restrictions but developmental supports that help young people practice virtue until it becomes habit.

## **The Anxiety Connection: The Belonging Crisis**

The shift away from character frameworks coincides with rising rates of anxiety and depression among young people. This connection involves both individual decision-making and community belonging.

**Decision Fatigue:** Without clear moral frameworks embedded in community expectations, ethical decisions become unnecessarily complex. Should I cheat on this test? Should I exclude this classmate? Should I stand up to bullying? Foundational principles embedded in community identity provide shortcuts to better decisions, reducing cognitive load on developing brains.

**Limited Community Connection:** Research suggests that young people who belong to multiple communities—family, faith communities, service organizations, athletic teams, arts groups—demonstrate greater resilience than those whose social connections are limited to their immediate peer groups. Character-based programs create what researcher Robert Putnam calls "social capital"—networks of relationships that provide meaning, support, and identity across generations.

**Young people without multiple community connections may be more vulnerable to anxiety.** SEL teaches coping skills for anxiety; character-based education can help prevent some of the isolation and decision fatigue that contribute to anxiety in the first place.

## **The Research Evidence**

Multiple studies provide compelling evidence for the effectiveness of character-based education and service learning:

**The Tufts Longitudinal Study:** Dr. Richard Lerner and his team followed nearly 1,800 youth over two and a half years, comparing participants in character-based programs (Cub Scouts) with non-participants (Lerner et al., 2015). Scouts became significantly more cheerful, helpful, kind, obedient, trustworthy, and hopeful compared to non-Scouts. Both groups started with equivalent character measures, demonstrating that structured character education *develops* virtue rather than simply attracting already-virtuous youth.

**The Harris Poll Study on Ethics and Character:** A 2024 comprehensive study of over 3,200 Americans comparing Scouting participants with the general population found striking differences (The Harris Poll, 2024):

* **Early Moral Development:** Scouting alumni begin discussing values and ethics with their children at age 4.5-4.7, compared to 6.1-6.6 years for non-participants, creating generational transmission of character education.

* **Ethical Behavior:** When presented with ethical scenarios, Scouts and alumni consistently chose the moral path at higher rates—100% would return excess change versus 97% of non-participants, and 100% would properly dispose of trash versus 90% of the general population.

* **Civic Engagement:** 98-99% of Scouts and alumni view voting in every election as important citizenship behavior, compared to 91% of the general population.

**The 4-H Study of Positive Youth Development:** The largest longitudinal study of youth development programming followed over 7,000 youth across 42 states, finding that when programs promoted the "Five Cs" (Competence, Confidence, Connection, Caring, and Character), youth developed the sixth C—Contribution—and became active, engaged citizens (Arnold, 2018). The study identified three key program features: positive adult relationships, life-skill building activities, and opportunities for youth leadership.

**Service Learning Research:** Multiple studies document the power of community service in character development:

* **Academic and Mental Health Benefits:** A 2024 meta-analysis found that service learning significantly improves academic performance while reducing anxiety and depression symptoms (Cipriano & Strambler, 2023).

* **Character Development:** Students in service learning programs show measurable increases in empathy, civic responsibility, and moral reasoning compared to traditional academic-only approaches (Tucker & McCarthy, 2001).

* **Belonging and Purpose:** Research consistently shows that students involved in service work report stronger connections to community and greater sense of purpose, both protective factors against anxiety (Soria et al., 2019).

These studies demonstrate that character-based programs don't just teach skills—they shape moral reasoning, civic responsibility, and authentic belonging in measurable ways that persist into adulthood.

## **The Great Abandonment: How Good Intentions Led Us Astray**

The shift from character education to SEL didn't happen by accident. It emerged from legitimate concerns about equity and cultural responsiveness in the 1990s and early 2000s.

Educators rightly recognized that traditional character education had often assumed cultural homogeneity and reflected the values of dominant groups. When students from diverse backgrounds brought different cultural values to school, the response was often to demand conformity rather than seek understanding.

The solution seemed obvious: step back from explicit character education altogether. Rather than risk imposing one group's values on another, schools would focus on developing students' capacity to navigate social and emotional challenges independently. CASEL formed in 1994, with SEL emerging as the perfect alternative—research-backed, skills-focused, and culturally neutral.

The institutional shift is documented in federal policy: the Department of Education stopped mentioning "character," "virtue," or "moral" in strategic plans after 2007, precisely as SEL gained momentum through federal funding mechanisms.

But in our attempt to honor all cultures, we inadvertently removed the shared moral foundation and authentic community belonging that young people need while their brains develop. **We threw out the guardrails and community connections along with the cultural bias.**

## **SEL's Strengths and Limitations**

This critique shouldn't diminish SEL's genuine contributions:

* **Assessment and measurement**: You can track progress in self-awareness and relationship skills more easily than "trustworthiness" and "courage."
* **Integration with academics**: SEL competencies mesh naturally with content learning.
* **Cultural responsiveness**: SEL frameworks can adapt to diverse cultural contexts without imposing specific moral content.
* **Research foundation**: The evidence base for SEL interventions is robust and growing.

![CASEL Framework](https://www.illuminateed.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CASEL-Wheel.jpg)
*The CASEL framework recognizes that students need multiple contexts (schools, families, communities) for development, but treats these as delivery systems for individual competencies rather than authentic places of belonging and moral formation.*

The outer ring of the CASEL framework illustrates this limitation perfectly. While CASEL acknowledges that students need schools, families, communities, and other settings working together, it approaches these contexts as **places to teach skills** rather than **communities where students belong and contribute**. The visual suggests the kind of multiple community connections that research shows are protective against anxiety—but CASEL's implementation focuses on coordinating skill-building rather than fostering authentic belonging.

But SEL's strengths are also its limitations. By focusing on skills rather than values, process rather than content, SEL provides tools without purpose. Students learn how to navigate social situations but not why certain choices matter more than others. They develop emotional regulation but lack the moral framework and authentic community belonging that gives emotions meaning.

## **The Path Forward: Integration, Not Replacement**

The solution isn't to abandon SEL but to recognize its limitations and restore what we've lost. **Schools need both approaches.** Students need the skills that SEL provides—emotional regulation, social awareness, relationship management. But they also need the moral foundation and authentic belonging that character education offers.

![SEL vs CBE Venn Diagram](https://porttack.com/docs/assets/images/SELvsCBE.png)
*SEL and Character-Based Education aren't competing frameworks but complementary approaches. Their intersection—authentic community belonging, moral decision-making frameworks, and opportunities for meaningful contribution—provides the foundation for healthy youth development.*

This integration should focus on creating **multiple authentic belongings** for every student:

**Measure and Foster Belonging:** Schools should collect data not just on SEL competencies but on student belonging. Which students feel connected to communities beyond their immediate peer groups? How many different communities does each student belong to? Students with multiple belongings—family, faith communities, service organizations, athletics, arts, neighborhood networks—consistently show greater resilience and lower anxiety rates.

**Revive Service Learning and Community Engagement:** The research on service learning is clear—students who contribute meaningfully to their communities develop stronger character, better academic outcomes, and improved mental health. Schools should require community service hours, create meaningful service learning opportunities, and connect academic content to community problems students can help solve.

**Restore the "Club Period":** Many schools historically had dedicated time during the school day for service clubs, honor societies, and community organizations. This addressed equity concerns by ensuring all students could participate regardless of transportation or after-school availability. A modern "club period" could include Scouts, 4-H, Key Club, Interact, mock trial, debate, athletics, arts, and academic societies—creating multiple pathways for authentic belonging within character-based communities.

**Partner with Character-Based Organizations:** Rather than creating character education from scratch, schools should partner with existing community organizations that embody character-based principles. These partnerships provide students access to intergenerational communities with established moral frameworks and service traditions.

**Teach Virtues Explicitly:** Alongside SEL competencies, schools should name and teach virtues explicitly—integrity, courage, service, responsibility, compassion. These provide the moral framework that gives emotional and social skills direction and purpose.

**Support Intergenerational Connection:** Character formation happens best in communities that span generations. Schools should create opportunities for students to learn from and contribute to adults who embody the virtues they hope to develop—whether through mentorship programs, community partnerships, or service learning projects.

The goal isn't to return to the cultural imperialism of past character education programs but to provide young people with multiple opportunities for authentic belonging within communities that share clear moral expectations and provide meaningful opportunities for contribution.

## **The Stakes Are High**

We're not just debating educational methodologies here. We're shaping how young people understand their relationship to others and their responsibilities as community members in an era of unprecedented social isolation.

**SEL without character education is like teaching advanced mathematics without arithmetic, or composition without grammar.** Students need both the skills and the foundation. But more fundamentally, they need authentic belonging within communities that share moral expectations and provide opportunities for meaningful contribution.

The mental health crisis among young people isn't just about screen time or academic pressure—it's about belonging. When students feel like valued contributors to multiple authentic communities, they develop resilience that no amount of individual coping skills can replicate.

Character-based education isn't the enemy of social-emotional learning—it's the foundation that makes SEL meaningful and the community context that makes individual competencies matter. When we provide young people with both emotional skills and moral frameworks, both individual competencies and authentic belonging, we prepare them not just for academic and social success but for lives of purpose and contribution.

The question isn't whether character education belongs in schools. It's whether we have the courage to admit what we've lost—the deep community connections that once provided young people with identity, purpose, and belonging—and the wisdom to restore it in ways that honor both our diverse communities and our shared humanity.
