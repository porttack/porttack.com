My goal this year was to bring back the Lions speech contest to students in the schools I support. Retoric is a fantastic way to promote youth leadership and what better way to motivate than a potential $20k scholarship for the winner. It is important to hear youth voices.

The Lion's topic was "Social Media: Connects us or Isolates us". The trick was, my Lions club could only support 4 to 6 student speakers. What if too many students registered? And how could I also promote the Rotary speech contest and its $1500 prize?

So I engaged parent groups at two schools and helped them create speech contests to filter students to Lions and Rotary contests. See https://speechcontests2023.com.

Two parent contests, three lion contests, four rotary contests and a dozen+ students later and finally it is all over!  I heard some frightened students face their fears. I also saw several students inspire other students (and adults) and take one more step toward leadership in their communities.

And my reward? My son visited one contest and was inspred by one student's speech. I didn't push as teens always do the opposite of what Dad suggests. But he decided to write a speech. He worked at it. He practiced. He took feedback at the the club level, learned, and improved at area level. And the content was about community. The apple didn't fall far the tree. But a spark was lit and he joined Interact is headed to RYLA. Next year will be more fun. Sometimes things work out. :-)
