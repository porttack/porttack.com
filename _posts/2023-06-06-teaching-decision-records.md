Just like the thrilling world of engineering (or the rollercoaster ride of parenting 🎢), there's a whirlwind of decisions to make. Teachers, like captains at the helm, make choices about classroom management, procedures, assessments, grading, incentives, and discipline, all varying based on their unique school environment. Sometimes these decisions are intricate puzzles, and at other times, they're a team sport calling for collaboration. 🧩🤝

Many cutting-edge engineering companies have started using Architecture Decision Records to navigate through decision-making. This process is like a Swiss Army knife - it can apply to a multitude of decisions!
