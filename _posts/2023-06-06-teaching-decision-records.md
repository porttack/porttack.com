Just like engineering (or parenting), there are many decisions to make. Most teachers make decisions about classroom management, procedures, assessments, grading, incentives and discipline to one degree or another (depending on their school). Sometimes the decisions are complex and sometimes collaboration is desired.

Many engineering companies have trended toward using Architecture Decision Records to make decisions. The process can apply to many types of decisions.

Career Technical Education is taught by professionals such as myself. And in such cases, CTE teachers are also selecting curriculum as well.

## Goals

* Encourage collaboration and feedback from educators & other relevant individuals (could be professionals, parents, and even students at some level)
* Living documents. Reflections and updated information is desired.
* Encourage adaptation of existing new and old ideas for todayâ€™s classrooms.

## Sections

These are all optional. And updates at any time are encouraged.

* Decision - What is the current decision?
* Status - Is the decision made? Awaiting feedback? Under analysis?
* Decision Context - What is prompting this analysis?
* Problem Statement - What are we trying to solve?
* Options Considered - Likely long presentation of options
* Decision rationale - Useful when there are many options
* Implementation Plan - May point to other documents
* Potential Risks and Mitigation
* Reflections and Lessons Learned
* References and appendixes
