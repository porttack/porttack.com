This is not a difficult decision for silicon veterans. It has always been considered a "teaching language". A huge set of modern software engineering problems have solutions as python programs.

Yet it is far from the default choice for k12. Why? Block languages like Scratch and code.org are simply easier to get started with. There's minimal typing (which can be difficult for younger students and even for many older students). Just click-and-drag to code a solution. Neither teachers nor students need to know how to type or understand syntax. What could be easier?

## What can you do in Python that you cannot do in blocks?

How about downloading global temperature statistics from the internet, manipulating and plotting them in a few lines of code?

How about reading air quality levels from a simple sensor and uploading that every second to a real time graph on the web?

A student can use a free machine learning library to decide if images taken by a raspberry pi camera represent a feral cat or raccoon prowling their school after hours.

Most importantly, a student studying python over 2 to 3 years in k12 will retain this knowledge to solve problems in math, science, humanities or wherever their passions carry them as they finish high school and continue to college and career.

## Blocks still has its place

Multiple educational programming environments now allow students to switch between blocks and python. Watching these environments translate code is sometimes impressive. (And sometimes it is buggy.)

I always thought I'd do my best to restrict access to blocks so as to force students to use python.

But recently at work I decided to ask ChatGPT to write a python program to accomplish a specific task. And I kept using ChatGPT to refine the program and fix its own bugs. Let's get real -- this is how many future computer scientists will work.

What is the difference between using ChatGPT to write a python program (complete with comments) and using blocks and then converting that to python?

Foreign language teachers must be laughing at other teachers. After all, they've been living with google translate for a half decade now.

## Teaching Blocks

That I'm not doing. I asked a scratch PD facilitator how to grade scratch programs. They suggested students take screen shots and submit those. No thanks.


When my son was in 3rd grade, he used an Arduino to simulate a die roll. An Arduino is a microcontroller used in many high school robotics courses. Five years ago, it could only be programmed in the "C" language. Today Arduino's understand python.
