For tech veterans, the choice is clear. Python, often considered a "teaching language", is the go-to solution for a vast array of modern software engineering problems. However, it's not the default choice for K12 education. Why?

Block languages like Scratch and code.org are more accessible for beginners. They require minimal typing, which can be challenging for younger or less experienced students. The click-and-drag interface eliminates the need for understanding syntax or typing skills. It's an easy introduction to coding, but does it limit students' potential?

## Python's Potential: Beyond Blocks

What can Python offer that block languages can't? Imagine downloading global temperature statistics from the internet, manipulating, and plotting them in just a few lines of code. Or reading air quality levels from a sensor and uploading the data to a real-time web graph every second.

With Python, students can use free machine learning libraries to identify whether images taken by a Raspberry Pi camera are of a feral cat or a raccoon. The knowledge gained from studying Python for 2 to 3 years in K12 can be applied to solve problems in math, science, humanities, and beyond, providing a strong foundation for college and career.

## The Role of Block Languages

Block languages aren't obsolete. Many educational programming environments now allow students to switch between blocks and Python. The translation of code in these environments can be impressive, albeit sometimes buggy.

I once thought restricting access to blocks would encourage students to use Python. However, I've found value in using AI like ChatGPT to write and refine Python programs. This approach mirrors how many future computer scientists will work. Is there really a difference between using ChatGPT to write a Python program and converting block code to Python?

Foreign language teachers have been using tools like Google Translate for years. It's time for coding education to embrace similar advancements.

## The Future of Coding Education

I won't be teaching block languages. When asked how to grade Scratch programs, a facilitator suggested students take screenshots and submit those. That's not the future I envision.

When my son was in 3rd grade, he used an Arduino, a microcontroller common in high school robotics courses, to simulate a die roll. Five years ago, it could only be programmed in the "C" language. Today, Arduinos understand Python. This evolution reflects the future of coding education - a future where Python plays a central role. üöÄüêç
