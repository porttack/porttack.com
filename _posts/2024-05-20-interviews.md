After my AP Computer Science students finished their exam, I wanted to give them something practical and valuable. So we did something different: 25-minute mock job interviews that simulated real tech industry hiring practices.

## Why Mock Interviews Matter

Most of our students will face technical interviews someday, but we rarely prepare them for this reality. Traditional computer science education focuses on algorithms and syntax, but job interviews test communication, problem-solving under pressure, and the ability to think aloud while coding.

## Setting Up Remote Interviews

Since many tech interviews happen remotely now, I set up a realistic simulation with students interviewing from a separate room via video call. We used a shared coding environment and I partnered with one of my strongest students as a co-interviewer.

The remote format actually made students *more* comfortable than traditional whiteboard coding. They could focus on problem-solving instead of worrying about their handwriting or drawing syntax errors.

## The Interview Structure

Each 25-minute interview included behavioral questions, technical discussion, and live coding challenges.

## What Students Learned

The experience was eye-opening for everyone. Students discovered that:
- Talking through your thought process is harder than silent coding
- Simple problems become challenging under interview pressure
- Communication skills matter as much as technical knowledge
- Practice makes a huge difference in confidence

One student commented, "I never realized how much I talk to myself when I code normally!"

*Sometimes the best preparation for the future happens when we step outside the traditional curriculum and simulate what students will actually encounter.*
