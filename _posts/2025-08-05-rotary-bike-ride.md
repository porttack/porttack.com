I'm stepping outside my comfort zone and participating in a 200 mile bike ride to raise money for [Aztecas Youth Soccer Academy](https://www.bikesignup.com/Race/SantaCruzSunriseRotaryRide3Day/Page-15) in Watsonville.

Aztecas mission is to reclaim the lives of at-risk youth that struggle with gangs, violence, poverty, and drugs in Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties. The academy was established to provide an alternative to gang involvement and violence, using soccer as a unifying and empowering tool. (Donate here: [https://www.bikesignup.com/PedalingForPurpose](https://www.bikesignup.com/PedalingForPurpose).)

Why? I believe in helping others and doing service work. I think this builds community and makes a stronger society. My son and I did a [service project in Guatemala](https://porttack.com/2025/04/05/guatemala.html) this spring. Supporting Aztecas with our friends in Santa Cruz Sunrise Rotary is our next adventure. (And maybe I'll get in a bit more shape?)

I invite you to [read more](https://www.bikesignup.com/Race/SantaCruzSunriseRotaryRide3Day/Page-15) about Aztecas and how, through our partnership, we will support our young community members.

In addition, as always, the ride will provide support to other community organizations dedicated to the health, well-being and growth of youth in our community. Included this year are: [Sienna House](https://www.sienahouse.org/), whose mission is to give the best start in life to new mothers and their babies experiencing homelessness, by providing a supportive environment throughout pregnancy and a baby's critical first year of development. And The [Cabrillo College Children's Center](https://www.cabrillo.edu/childrens-center/) a place to Transform the Future Together, From Birth to Adulthood by offering a high-quality and diverse early care and education learning environment and a strong Early Childhood Workforce Development Program.

As always, the ride also provides support for the Santa Cruz Sunrise Rotary's High School Scholarships program (providing 2 and 4-year college scholarship) and the Charities and Grants program (providing grants to local youth athletic and arts organizations).
I've committed to fundraise a minimum of $1000 with a personal goal of $1500! So please consider sponsoring me for this ride. With an all-volunteer crew 100% of the proceeds go to the charities, and it's all tax deductible as the Rotary Club of Santa Cruz Sunrise Foundation, Inc. is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit.
