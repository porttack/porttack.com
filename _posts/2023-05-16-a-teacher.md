I signed a teaching contract with SLVUSD to teach Middle School and High School Computer Science in 2023-24. I'm very excied to make this career change.

As a parent in this school district, an active scout leader, and a rotary youth chair, I’ve created and led various enrichment programs and parent groups. It feels more like finally coming home than taking a new job. I don’t know everybody, but I know many teachers, parents, and professionals in my community and know I'm supported in this move.

It is the decision to shift from industry to teaching that is difficult. It may not make sense financially, but it better represents my identity. It is time to give back. And how better to bring safety, character, and virtue to the youth in a community than to be actively present for them.

Teaching is hard. Being a new teacher is challenging. But silicon valley is getting boring. New things are always a little scary, but that's a good thing.

Life is not about making easy choices and having fun; it is about making a difference.
