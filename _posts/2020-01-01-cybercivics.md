As parents and educators, we strive to equip our children with the necessary skills and knowledge to navigate the digital landscape responsibly. When my daughter attended a Waldorf school, her teacher introduced me to an exceptional program called [CyberCivics](https://www.cybercivics.com/), which proved to be a breath of fresh air compared to other digital citizenship curricula like "Common Sense Media."

What captivated me about Cyber Civics was its emphasis on fostering real-world connections before delving into the online realm. It prioritizes content creation over consumption. Rather than instilling fear and focusing solely on practicalities like password security, Cyber Civics aims to inspire our children to become active participants in shaping both their physical and digital communities.

Motivated by the program's message, I acquired the curriculum for my son's middle school. Before the pandemic disrupted our lives, I had the privilege of teaching several lessons. Witnessing the students fully engaged, their minds and thoughts on the various challenges faced in both the digital and physical spheres, I was inspired.

Cyber Civics is [aligned with some common core ELA standards](https://www.cybercivics.com/educational-standards-alignment), presenting an opportunity to integrate this invaluable learning into our classrooms. By doing so, we not only create room for these essential discussions but also provide our children with an expanded educational experience.

For parents and teachers seeking a comprehensive resource to enhance their understanding of digital citizenship, I wholeheartedly recommend diving into [Raising Humans in a Digital World: Helping Kids Build a Healthy Relationship with Technology](https://www.cyberwise.org/book) by Diana Graber. Drawing from her experience teaching the curriculum to middle school students as she developed it, Graber's well-researched book offers invaluable insights, practical strategies, and thought-provoking lessons on fostering a healthy relationship with technology. By immersing yourself in Graber's expertise, you'll gain the knowledge and tools necessary to guide your children and students towards responsible digital citizenship in today's interconnected world.
