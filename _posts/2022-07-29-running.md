578 days and 780 miles.

At the start of 2021, I made a simple yet resolute commitment to myself: run one mile every day, without fail. No matter where I found myself – be it in California, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Florida, or even amidst a road trip – I ensured that I laced up my running shoes and hit the pavement.

One mile per day was always achievable and carried limited risk of recurring plantar fasciitis. Additionally, running every day could help me sleep better. 

This seemingly modest goal brought about a newfound appreciation for the ever-changing weather and seasons. It provided me with a constant excuse and motivation to step outside and stay true to my resolution.

On December 31st, I headed to the SLV track to complete my final mile. It was there, that I bumped into a high school track coach I hadn't seen in years. We exchanged stories, and he shared his own battle with plantar fasciitis during his attempt to run a mile every day for a thousand days. A thousand? Could I really make December 31st my last day?

Realistically, no. I kept going for almost seven more months. Yet, in a moment of enthusiasm, in June I sprinted one early morning to join a group photo, my mind outrunning my legs. Unfortunately, I pulled my hamstring in the process. But I'm stubborn and kept running for months longer. Running is a mental sport, and it took some therapy to admit that trying to reach 1000 days could have long-ranging consequences. It was time to take a break.

I learned many things from this experiment:
* I slept much better during these 18 months, and as a result, my mood was more consistent.
* The time required for my runs meant I naturally ignored less important items on my to-do list.
* Running every day lowered my heart rate by 15-20 beats per minute, which initially induced fatigue that only went away with more exercise.
* The resolve to run every day is not more important than health. The hamstring pull was bad, as was the issue of fatigue.
* I prioritized my runs over family dinner time, and that too was unhealthy.
