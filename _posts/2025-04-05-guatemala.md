Last month, I joined ten other Rotarians from [Santa Cruz Sunrise Rotary](https://portal.clubrunner.ca/2276) on a self-funded trip to Guatemala. Our mission: install two water purification systems capable of producing 10,000 gallons of clean water daily and distribute 500 pairs of reading glasses to people who needed them. For me, this trip also offered something equally valuable - the chance to do meaningful service work alongside my 17-year-old son.

My son and I attend Sunrise Rotary meetings almost every Thursday morning, and he currently serves as the Santa Cruz area Interact District 5170 representative. This Guatemala trip represented our shared belief in Rotary's mission of service above self.

## Why This Matters

The statistics that drove our trip are sobering. In Guatemala, the average person receives only four years of education, and just three out of ten students graduate from sixth grade. Access to clean water and basic healthcare - things we take for granted - can be transformative.

The water purification systems we installed use advanced membrane technology to filter out bacteria and viruses, with a small amount of chlorine for additional safety. Similar systems have dramatically reduced infant mortality in Guatemalan hospitals.

As for the reading glasses? A 75-cent pair of eyeglasses can restore someone's ability to work and provide for their family. The impact is immediate and profound.

## A Teacher's Observations

What struck me most wasn't just the immediate impact of our work, but the parallels to education. At one school, I saw environmental awareness posters created by students - messages about protecting the planet, recycling, and caring for trees. These young people understand the challenges their generation faces and are thinking about solutions.

This reminded me why I teach computer science and robotics. Whether we're in California or Guatemala, young people need tools, opportunities, and belief in their potential to create change. Sometimes that's a water filter, sometimes it's a programming lesson, but it's always about opening possibilities.

## The Ripple Effect

Our $30,000 grant, funded entirely by local donations, represents more than clean water and clear vision. It's about dignity, opportunity, and the recognition that small actions can have enormous impact. A functioning water system doesn't just provide clean drinking water - it frees up time for education, reduces disease, and strengthens entire communities.

## Bringing It Home

This experience reinforced something I try to teach my students: we're all connected, and we all have something to contribute. Whether it's building an underwater robot to monitor ocean health or installing a water purification system in a Guatemalan village, the principles are the same - identify a problem, apply your skills, work with others, and don't give up.

The young people I teach daily will inherit a world with complex challenges. Experiences like this remind me that they're also inheriting a tradition of service, innovation, and the belief that ordinary people can do extraordinary things when they work together.
