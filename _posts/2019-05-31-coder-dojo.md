Most Tuesday nights of the 2018-19 school year were SLV CoderDojo nights. In the SLVE MU room, a few dedicated parents and two dozen engaged students ate pizza, had fun and learned together.

We used Raspberry Pi foundation [Code Club](https://codeclub.org) content along with special projects with microbits and a 3D printer to expand our knoledge and build friendships.

See the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PsiFyZ0ks4QpJpPbympqjSrSup0QnL82K-JNGON4ZIo/edit?usp=sharing) from our inception.
